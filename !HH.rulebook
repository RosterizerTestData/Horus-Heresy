Place a single model from that unit anywhere on the battlefield that is at least 6\" from any enemy model, battlefield edge or piece of Impassable Terrain and is outside of all Deployment Zones. Do not scatter the model.\n\nIf possible, the model must be placed in a position that will allow any other models in the same unit to deploy (as follows), and may only be placed in a position that denies the remainder of the squad a place within unit coherency if no other position is available.\n\nOnce the model’s final position has been decided, the remainder of the unit may be deployed anywhere that is within unit coherency and more than 6\" from any enemy model or piece of Impassable Terrain. Any models that cannot be placed are removed as casualties.\n\nOnce this first unit has been deployed, roll a D6. On the roll of a ‘1’, the Area Denial Drop is Disordered and the opposing player may deploy each remaining unit in the Area Denial Drop anywhere within 12\" of the first unit without scattering, though no model may be within 1\" of an enemy model or within Impassable Terrain. If the roll is a ‘2’ or higher, the controlling player deploys each remaining unit anywhere within 12\" of the first, though no model may be within 1\" of an enemy model or within Impassable Terrain.\n\nOnce all units are deployed, any enemy units within line of sight and range may choose to make the Interceptor Reaction (see page 309 of the Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook) targeting any one of the units deployed as part of the Area Denial Drop. Any units that are chosen to make the Interceptor Reaction do not expend any of the controlling player’s Reaction Allotment for the Phase, but do count as having made a Reaction (and thus cannot React again in this Phase). Note that no Reaction other than Interceptor may be made against the deployment of a unit as part of an Area Denial Drop.\n\nOnce all units from the Area Denial Drop have been deployed and any Interceptor Reactions have been resolved, the turn proceeds as normal. Units that have been deployed as part of an Area Denial Drop may not Move or Run in the same Movement phase as they are deployed, but may Shoot and declare Charges as normal (if the models deployed as part of the Area Denial Drop are allowed to make Charges)."

This means they can fire at a target that they do not have line of sight to, as long as the target is beyond their Minimum Range (if applicable). When firing indirectly, the Ballistic Skill of the firer is not subtracted from the scatter distance; unless a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice, the Blast marker always scatters a full 2D6\". If a Barrage weapon has line of sight to its target it can fire directly, even if the target is within its Minimum Range.\nNote that any Hits inflicted upon Vehicles by an Attack using the Barrage special rule are always resolved against the Vehicle’s Side Armour Value.\n\nMultiple Barrages\nIf a unit fires more than one shot with the Barrage special rule, they fire together, as follows:\nThe Barrage weapon closest to the target unit fires first. Place the Blast marker over the target, then roll for scatter as described earlier. Once the first marker is placed, roll a Scatter dice for each other Barrage weapon shot fired by the unit. If an arrow is rolled, place the marker in the direction indicated so that it is next to and touching the edge of the first marker placed (see diagram below). If a Hit is rolled, the firing player places the marker so that it touches any part of any marker in the group that has already been placed. Note that it is perfectly fine if some markers are placed overlapping one another (including being directly over the top of a previous marker). Once all of the markers are in place, add up the number of Hits and roll To Wound for these Hits. To determine Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the first Blast marker that was placed in the Multiple Barrage.\n\nApocalyptic Barrage\nAn Apocalyptic Barrage follows all of the rules for a Barrage weapon, but uses the clover-shaped Apocalyptic Barrage marker. Before the marker is placed, the attacker is allowed to rotate the marker about its centre to maximise the number of models that could potentially be hit. Place the marker and roll for scatter in the same way you would for a Blast. If the marker scatters, be careful to maintain the same orientation as you move it. \n\nOnce the final position of the marker has been determined, roll a number of dice equal to the number of attacks on the weapon’s profile. So, for example, with a weapon with the type ‘Heavy 4, Apocalyptic Barrage’, you would roll four dice. Each dice roll corresponds to a ‘strike’ on one of the circles on the Apocalyptic Barrage marker. For example, each roll of a 2 indicates a strike on circle number 2. Resolve the strikes as for a Multiple Barrage, as if each were a Barrage attack that had landed on that circle and hit all the models underneath it. To determine Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the entire Apocalyptic Barrage marker."

Instead, pick one enemy model visible to the firer and place the Blast (3\") marker with its hole entirely over the base of the target model, or its hull if the target is a Vehicle. The hole at the centre of the marker must be within the weapon’s Maximum Range. You cannot place the Blast marker so that the base or hull of any friendly model is even partially under it.\n\nThe large area affected by the blast means it is going to be very hard to miss completely. Nonetheless, the shot might not land exactly where intended. Roll for the Blast marker to scatter and subtract the firer’s Ballistic Skill from the distance (if any) that it scatters, to a minimum of 0\". Note that it is possible, and absolutely fine, for a shot to scatter beyond the weapon’s Maximum or Minimum Range and line of sight. This represents the chance of ricochets, the missile blasting through cover and other random events. In these cases, Hits are worked out as normal and can hit and Wound units out of range and line of sight (or even your own units, or models locked in combat). If the shot scatters so that the hole in the centre of the marker is beyond the battlefield’s edge, the shot is a complete miss and is discarded.\n\nOnce the final position of the Blast marker has been determined, take a good look at it from above – each unit suffers one Hit for each of the models included in that unit that is fully or partially beneath the Blast marker, even if those models are not within the firer’s line of sight.\n\nOnce the number of Hits inflicted on the unit has been worked out, roll To Wound and Save as normal. Note that, unlike other attacks, Wounds inflicted by an attack with the Blast special rule can be allocated to any models in the target unit, even if they are out of sight of any models from the attacking unit.\n\nMultiple Blasts\nIf a unit is firing more than one shot with the Blast special rule, scatter each shot, one at a time, as described above and determine how many Hits are scored with each individual Blast marker. After the last shot, add up the total number of Hits scored and roll all of the To Wound rolls as normal.\n\nBlast Weapons and Re-rolls\nIf a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit and chooses to do so after firing a Blast weapon, the player must re-roll both the Scatter dice and the 2D6. Note that this applies only to models able to fully re-roll a To Hit roll, not to models that may re-roll To Hit rolls of a specific value – for example, models that can re-roll To Hit rolls of a ‘1’ cannot re-roll either the Scatter dice or 2D6 unless another rule allows them to do so.\n\nBlast Weapons and Snap Shots\nBlast weapons cannot be fired as Snap Shots.\n\nLarge Blast\nLarge Blast weapons use the 5\" Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.\n\nMassive Blast\nMassive Blast weapons use the 7\" Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.\n\nApocalyptic Blast\nApocalyptic Blast weapons use the 10\" Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.\n\nApocalyptic Mega-blast (5\"/7\"/10\")\nApocalyptic Mega-blast weapons use the Apocalyptic Blast marker. They obey the rules for Blast weapons, with the following exceptions:\n\nApocalyptic Mega-blast weapons have three Strength values and three AP values. Correspondingly, the Apocalyptic Blast marker is divided into three zones, as shown in the diagram on the next page, one for each Strength and AP value.\n\nThe Strength and AP of any Hits depends on the zone in which the target model is located. The first Strength and AP value are used for the inner zone, the second Strength and AP value are used for the middle zone, and the third Strength and AP value are used for the outer zone. Always use the best Strength and AP if a model straddles two or more zones. If a unit has models in several zones, work out the Hits inflicted for each zone separately. Note that there will be a different Wound Pool for each zone.\n\nTo determine whether a unit wounded by an Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapon is allowed a Cover Save, and when determining Wound allocation, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the Apocalyptic Blast marker, instead of from the firing model.\n\nHits from Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons made against Vehicles are always resolved against their Side Armour Value."

Any models fully or partially under the template are hit. Against Vehicles, the template must be placed to cover as much of the Vehicle as possible without touching a friendly model. The position of the firer is used to determine which armour Facing is hit (see page 207). A Template weapon never hits the model firing it.\n\nTemplate weapons have the Ignores Cover and Wall of Death special rules. Wounds inflicted by Template weapons are allocated following the normal rules.\n\nMultiple Templates\nIf a unit is firing more than one shot with the Template type, resolve each shot, one at a time, as described above, determining and recording how many Hits are scored by each template. Once the number of Hits from all templates has been determined, roll To Wound as normal.\n\nWall of Death\nTemplate weapons can fire Snap Shots at any non-Flyer target. If a Template weapon fires as a Snap Shot, it automatically inflicts D3 Hits on the target unit, resolved at its normal Strength and AP value, as long as the target unit either has at least one model within 8\" or if the target unit is resolving a Charge against the unit making the Shooting Attack. If the weapon is also a Hellstorm weapon then it instead inflicts D6 Hits.\n\nHellstorm Weapons\nHellstorm weapons have the word ‘Hellstorm’ instead of a range on their weapon profile.
